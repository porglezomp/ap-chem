title: Significant Figures
chapter: 1

Significant figures refer to how many digits or decimal places in a number really represent the measurement that was made. If you don't have an accurate scale, saying that you measure 12.35123g is silly, because the error could be as much as Â±1g (for example.)

When you perform a calculation, you use the lowest value for your significant figures, because the errors of the worst measurement get included in your calculation. Here we include some example calculations below.
