Properties can be divided into **chemical properties** and **physical properties**, as well as into **intensive** and **extensive** properties.

- **Chemical properties** are properties characteristic of how a substance
  reacts with another. Measuring a chemical property changes the substance that you're measuring it on.

- **Physical properties** are properties that can be measure without changing
  the substance. These are things like color, mass, volume, etc.

Seperate from the chemical/physical distinction, you also have

- **Intensive properties** (also called **characteristic properties**) are
  properties which don't vary with the sample size. These are things like the density of a substance, the reactivity, and more. These can be used to help identify what a substance is.

- **Extensive properties** are the opposite. They depend on the sample size,
  they're things like the mass of a substance, or the volume. They don't help in determining what a substance is, because a Kg of gold is no different from a Kg of feathers.
