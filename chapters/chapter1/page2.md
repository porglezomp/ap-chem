Matter can be classified in several ways, the first of which is the distinction between **pure substances** and **mixtures**.

Pure substances have fixed ratios of components, and the particles are all bound together. If you take multiple samples of the substance, it will always have the same parts. There are two types of pure substances, **elements** and **compounds**.

- **Elements** are pure substances which contain only a single kind of atom,
  for instance, O<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>.

- **Compounds** are pure substances which contain multiple kinds of atom in a 
  fixed ratio, for instance, {{ water }} is a compound which always has 2 hydrogen for each oxygen.

Mixtures have a variable composition, and are not bound together. A mixture may consist of many different elements or compounds, for instance, salt water has both NaCl and {{ water }} in it, but neither are bound to the other, and the ratio of salt to water is not the same for all salt water. Mixtures can be further classified into **homogeneous mixtures** (also called **solutions**) and **heterogeneous mixtures**.

- **Homogeneous mixtures** are the same wherever you look in them, for example,
  one sample of a glass of salt water will look basically the same as another sample from that same glass.

- **Heterogeneous mixtures** are not evenly mixed, if you look at different 
  places in them, you will find slightly different compounds. They can be said to be "clumpy." Examples are things such as dirt, stew, mixtures of powders, and a tremendous variety more.
