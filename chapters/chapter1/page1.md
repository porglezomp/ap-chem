We should start off our look by defining what we're studying, chemistry itself is defined as.
> The study of matter, its properties, composition, and interactions

And matter is defined as being
> A physical substance which takes up space and has mass

For the purpose of chemistry, matter is considered to be made out of atoms.\*
Matter can be classified and described by many properties, both physical and chemical, which we will now discuss.


\* There are more exotic forms of matter not made out of atoms, but this treatment will ignore them.
