title: Dimensional Analysis
chapter: 1
---

Dimensional analysis is doing math with multiple dimensions. You use it when you want to add apples to oranges, or perhaps multiply apples by oranges. More practically, it allows you to convert between different physical units, and perform math that crosses the boundary between different types of units. For example, diving a length by a time is perfectly valid: it produces a speed.

Most of the dimensional analysis we'll do in Chemistry class will simply be canceling parts of fractions.

I don't have any examples here yet.
